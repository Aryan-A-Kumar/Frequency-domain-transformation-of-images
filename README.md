# Image Processing with FFT and iFFT

This project demonstrates image processing using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (iFFT) in Python. The code computes FFT and iFFT of an image, visualizes the magnitude and phase spectrum, and performs specific operations on an image (`dip.tiff`) using custom FFT and iFFT functions.

## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to:
- Compute the FFT and iFFT of an image.
- Visualize the magnitude and phase spectrum.
- Apply a series of image processing operations to an image using FFT and iFFT.

The project is inspired by exercises from "Digital Image Processing" by Gonzalez and Woods and NPTEL lectures by Prof. P.K. Biswas.

## Installation

To run the code, you need Python 3 and the following libraries:
- numpy
- matplotlib
- pillow

Install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib pillow
```

## Usage

1. **Download or clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-processing-fft.git
   cd image-processing-fft
   ```

2. **Run the code**:

   Ensure you have an image named `dip.tiff` in the same directory or provide a path to an image file in the `process_image` function.

   ```python
   python fft_image_processing.py
   ```

## Functions Overview

### 1. `compute_fft(image)`

- Computes the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of a given image.
- Returns the FFT result, magnitude spectrum, and phase spectrum.

### 2. `compute_ifft(fft_data)`

- Computes the Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (iFFT) of the given FFT data.
- Returns the iFFT result.

### 3. `visualize_spectrum(magnitude_spectrum, phase_spectrum)`

- Visualizes the magnitude and phase spectrum of an image using Matplotlib.

### 4. `load_image(image_path)`

- Loads an image from the specified path and converts it to grayscale.

### 5. `multiply_image_by_negative_power(image)`

- Multiplies an image by (-1)^(x+y) to shift the zero-frequency component to the center.

### 6. `process_image(image_path)`

- Performs the following operations on the input image:
  1. Multiplies the image by (-1)^(x+y).
  2. Computes the FFT of the modified image.
  3. Computes the complex conjugate of the FFT result.
  4. Computes the iFFT of the complex conjugate.
  5. Multiplies the real part of the iFFT result by (-1)^(x+y).
- Displays the resultant image after processing.

## Experiment Steps

To process the image and observe the transformations:

1. **Multiply Image by (-1)^(x+y)**: Shifts the zero-frequency component to the center.
2. **Compute FFT**: Transforms the image to the frequency domain.
3. **Compute Complex Conjugate of FFT**: Reflects the frequency components.
4. **Compute iFFT of Complex Conjugate**: Returns to the spatial domain with mirrored content.
5. **Multiply the Real Part by (-1)^(x+y)**: Re-centers the zero-frequency component in the spatial domain.

## Explanation of Output

The final output image is a mirrored or flipped version of the original image due to the combination of FFT, complex conjugation, and iFFT operations. The process showcases the effect of frequency domain manipulations on spatial domain images.
