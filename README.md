# Image Processing with FFT and iFFT

This project demonstrates image processing using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (iFFT) in Python. The code computes FFT and iFFT of an image, visualizes the magnitude and phase spectrum, and performs specific operations on an image (`dip.tiff`) using custom FFT and iFFT functions.

## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to:
- Compute the FFT and iFFT of an image.
- Visualize the magnitude and phase spectrum.
- Apply a series of image processing operations to an image using FFT and iFFT.

The project is inspired by exercises from "Digital Image Processing" by Gonzalez and Woods and NPTEL lectures by Prof. P.K. Biswas.

## Installation

To run the code, you need Python 3 and the following libraries:
- numpy
- matplotlib
- pillow

Install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib pillow
